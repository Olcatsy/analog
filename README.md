#Analog

## Concept
A creativity exercise that gives you a one word prompt of an abstract concept that you have to sketch without drawing recognizable objects (an analog drawing). The user can share their art to a public gallery and see how other people interpreted these concepts.<br />
This app is heavily inspired by [Betty Edwards'](https://www.drawright.com/) book Drawing on the Artist Within.
